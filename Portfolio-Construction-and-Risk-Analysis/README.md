# Portfolio Construction and Risk Analysis 

As a part of coursework team from Statistical Methods in Finance at Columbia University. I developed the materials in this repository with my teammates: Aruna and Boris. I contributed to the MVP Optimization part, coding Risk Management aspect in the terms of VaR and ES, and writing all the sections of the Report except sections 3, 5 and 7.
