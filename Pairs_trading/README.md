# Pairs Trading Exploration of VISA and Mastercard

I was intrigued by how VISA and Mastercard (two competitors) was having such high correlations in returns. Furthermore, during my portfolio construction and analysis using factor analysis, I saw that the result grouped Mastercard and VISA together. Hence, I wanted to explore various heuristics and strategies we can employ to perform Pairs Trading of these two stocks. I tried to implement and backtest the following strategies as part of my ML in Finance course individual project:

- "Buying the yesterday's loser strategy"
- Logistic Regression Heuristic
- Decision Trees strategy with Feature Engineering
- Future Work: Hyperparameter Tuning, Ensembling, Cointegration, and Kalman Filters
