# ML-based Trading Exploration

As someone who is really excited about application of various ML Algorithms in Finance, while taking ML in Finance course at Columbia University, I decided to use Machine Learning to predict and trade (backtest) stocks in the financial markets. I teamed up with 3 graduate students namely Boris, Aime and Daniel, and decided to study MVO, Neural Nets, and Equal Allocation based strategies. Here are the strategies we implemented, analyzed and presented as part of the final group project for the course:

- Equal Weights Naive trading strategy
- MVP Optimization trading strategy (with options to select weights based on risk tolerance, expected return and sharpe ratio)
- LSTM based prediction and trading strategy
- LSTM + GRU based prediction and trading strategy
- LSTM + GRU + Attention based prediction and trading strategy
- LSTM + CNN based trading strategy
